# Checklist for Northcoders News Front End

## README - write your own and make sure that it:

- [ ] has a link to the deployed version
- [ ] provides general info about your app
- [ ] includes links to your back end repo
- [ ] specifies the minimum version of Node required to run locally (check your Node version, `node --version` and use the major version that you are on)
- [ ] has clear instructions on how to run your project locally (`git clone <repo-url>, cd ...`)

## UX

- [ ] Tweak padding and margin to make sure everything feels like it has enough "space to breathe"
- [ ] Refreshing doesnâ€™t cause an issue on sub-pages (check on hosted version)
- [ ] No errors in the console

## Functionality

### Articles

- [ ] Can vote a maximum of once in either direction per page load

### Individual Article / Comments

- [ ] Can vote a maximum of once in either direction per page load

## Error Handling

- [ ] Bad url
- [ ] Bad article id in url
- [ ] Post comment: No text in comment body
- [ ] Post new article gives "article posted" with no details filled in
- [ ] Update user fails but gives positive feedback
- [ ] Make sure _every_ network request has a `.catch` block which acts to indicate to the user when something has gone wrong

## Code

- [ ] `Home` and `Articles` have very similar functionality. Is there any way for them to be made a little more DRY?

- [ ] `ArticleVoter` and `CommentVoter` are almost exactly the same. Could they be a single, generic component?

- [ ] Seems like most initial states are empty arrays even when you'll be storing other data types there?

- [ ] The `Articles` component has many jobs. Could it be split into smaller components? For example, you could pull out the form part?






- [ ] No `console.log`s / comments
- [ ] Indent every child element one level

## MAKE SURE ALL TESTS ARE STILL PASSING IN BACK END
